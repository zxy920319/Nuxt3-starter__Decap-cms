  # Nuxt3 - Decap CMS boilerplate

  
  **Live boilerplate example:** https://sailsnake-nuxt-decap-boilerplate.netlify.app


  **Link to repo:** https://github.com/Sfolkerts89/Nuxt3-starter__Decap-cms

  ## A simple starting point

  This boilerplate will get you going quick in building with Nuxt and Decap CMS. The base boilerplate consists out of the following:

  ### Decap CMS (config.yml)

  * SEO anchor ready to go (simply use "- &seo" in any page/ file collection)

  * Cloudinary support

  ### Pages

  * Home page (this README content)

  * A typography page with headings, paragraphs, list etc. to help you write your typography styles in one view

  ### Styling

  * Minimal boilerplate styling

  * Simple responsive GRID layout

  * Categorized .scss files (main.scss, mixins.scss, type.scss, variables.scss etc.)

  * variables.modules.scss which allows you to export your scss variables from variables.scss to be used in JS vars. Example: `const color = variables.myColor`

  ### Components

  * A simplistic menu component which switches to a mobile menu in small viewports

  * Layout components (logo, header, footer) already called in layout/default.vue

  * A markdown render component (based off the Nuxt Content module) that can render any markdown string

  ### Composables:

  * setSeoHead() composable: just feed the SEOmetaData object (defined in config.yaml) from your api data; `setSeoHead(apiData.SEOmetaData)`

  * useBtnData() composable: does an api call to /content/buttons.md and returns a single button string. Example `cosnt buttonText = useBtnData('buttonsApi.readmore')` => result: `"hello! Read moar!"`. Conistent button text's throughout your site when using `slot` in a `button.vue` component

  ## Install

  1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Sfolkerts89/Nuxt3-starter__Decap-cms.git' or click 'Use this template'

  2. `yarn install` or `npm install`

  4. Run frontend locally: `yarn dev' or `npm run dev'

  3. Boot up Decap CMS locally:
    * uncomment `locale_backend: true` (*leave this out in production for safety's sake*)
    * run `npx decap-server`
    * Navigate to: localhost:3000/admin (asuming you have a frontend instance running)

  ## Netlify deployment
    * Build command: `npm run generate` (dont use YARN: Node will run out of memory)
    * Publish directory: `dist`

  ## Boilerplate__extras/ (folder)

  I found it tough to decide wether to build an extranous boilerplate packed with features or to keep it clean and simple.. So i did both..
  Addtional code snippets, components and more can be found in the folder 'boilerplate__extras'. If you want to start clean and simple, just delete the folder!


  ### /decap__config/

  * basic 'products' collection (i.e. one level dynamic page names with a re-occuring content structure)

  * Dynamic Fields using Yaml anchors (much like a page builder) which includes a carousel/lightbox option for mulitple images

  * Dynamic Fields collection: code snippet that can be used as is and built upon/ changed to suite your needs.

  ### /nuxt__pages/

  #### /product/ + [slug].vue

  A simple dynamic page based of slug as a parameter set up as a 'products' page. This is in relation to the 'products' colleciton in boilerplate__extras/decap__config/

  #### Contact.vue
  
  Very simplistic contact page that includes the `<BasicInquery />' component. Place the 'forms' folder in a corresponding 'components' folder in your project and uncomment for use.

  #### dynamic-fields.vue

  A page that utlizes the `<dynamicFields />` component. This works in relation with:

  * The Dynamic Fields anchor provided in: /decap__config/
  * The Dynamic Fields collection provided in: /decap__config/
  
  #### Products.vue

  A simple page displays all the products in the products collection. 
 
  ### vue__components/forms/

  In this folder you will find modular form building components. Along with a simple contact form that utilizes a few of these. 
  Aside from being modular, the simple contact form has form input validation:

  1. Input field validation happens in the child component

  2. Child component emits validation data

  3. Parent component pushes data in an array and checks if all entries are valid

  ### /vue__components/media/

  #### Carousel.vue component with the following options via props:

  * imageOnly (Boolean): enable only an array of image links are provided

  * Slides (Array): image, caption

  * Timed (Boolean): enables timedSlides() function, a slideshow if you will

  * hasEnlarge: Enables an overlay on hover which allows for the carousel to enlarge to 100% of the container (full screen function)

  * Color (String): provide a color value for carousel colored elements

  #### RespImage.vue

  Responsive image component based on Cloudinary transformations

  #### Props

  * url (String): set up for filename only i.e. `"my-image.jpg"`

  * Lightbox (Boolean, default: false): enables lightbox function

  * Objectfit (String, default: null): sets CSS object-fit property

  * Color (String): passes color to lightbox accent color


  #### RespVideo.vue

  Responsive video component based on Cloudinary transformations

  #### Props

  * url (String): set up for filename only i.e. `"my-image.jpg"`

  * hasSound (Boolean, default: null): sets muted property. If hasSound is set, video controls will appear to allow playback. Otherwise playback will `autoplay` (if autoplay is set to true)

  * Autoplay (Boolean, default null): sets autoplay property when video is in view

  * loop (Boolean, default null): Sets loop propery

  * id (String):  the autoplay in view feature needs an element id to work. The video is is built using `:id` + `props.url.slice(-10)` (ensures unique id's per page)


  ### vue__components/misc/ (folder)

  * DynamicFields.vue:
  In here you will find the dynamicFields.vue component that corresponds with the 'dynamicFields.vue'. You will need this component to render the fields 'dynamic-fields' collection in dynamicFields.vue

  * Copyright.vue:
  A component displaying current year and your branding

    The United Chinese Professional Associations in Europe (UCPAE, also referred to as the "European Alliance") is officially registered in the China-Belgium Technology Center in Belgium, with registration code 1024.909.225. The mission of UCPAE is to promote communication and cooperation among its member associations, enhance connections and interactions among scholars, and facilitate close collaboration with universities, research institutions, and industry associations in both Europe and China. Its aim is to foster cooperation and development between China and Europe in the fields of science and technology, education, culture, and industry.

    UCPAE brings together Chinese professional associations and organizations from 14 European countries. Centered around the presidents and executive boards of these associations, it actively carries out diverse exchanges and cooperative initiatives. To date, UCPAE has organized over a hundred delegations to China and co-hosted dozens of high-level international academic conferences in Europe and China. It has also coordinated and advanced numerous public welfare projects. Additionally, it has successfully held fifteen editions of the "European Forum" in cities such as Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Vienna, The Hague, Frankfurt, Helsinki, Dublin, and Hamburg. These events have attracted significant attention and active participation from stakeholders across Europe and around the world, including institutions such as the EU and the United Nations.

    Member associations of UCPAE are located in major European countries including Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Hungary. The alliance brings together tens of thousands of Chinese professionals from a wide range of industries across Europe.

    UCPAE’s organizational structure is modeled after that of the European Union. Each year, a different country's member association and country assume the rotating presidency. However, unlike the EU’s fixed rotation system, UCPAE’s presidency is determined through democratic elections held at its annual general meeting. The Executive Council for the 2024–2025 term includes: Rotating President Guo Ming, President Song Zhiwei, Secretary-General Liu Xiaoling, Chief Financial Officer Li Li, Executive Deputy Secretary-General Luo Wei, and Deputy Secretary-General Wang Hong.

    established on November 21, 2001, and officially registered with the
    Frankfurt District Court in Germany, under registration number VR 12689. The
    mission of FCPAE is to foster communication and collaboration among member
    associations, enhance connections and interactions between scholars, and

    cooperation and development in the fields of science, education, culture,
    and industry between China and Europe.


    FCPAE brings together Chinese professional associations and institutions from more than ten countries across Europe.

Collectively, these member associations represent more than 20,000 Chinese professionals working in various industries across Europe.


    The organizational structure of the Federation is modeled after the European Union, with the chair association and chair country rotating annually.

The 2023/2024 Executive Council members include rotating chair Ding Li, President Song Zhiwei, Secretary-General Liu Xiaoling, Treasurer Li Li, and Executive Deputy Secretary-General Luo Kai.

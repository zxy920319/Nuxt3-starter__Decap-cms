    The Federation of Chinese Professional Associations in Europe (FCPAE) was
    established on November 21, 2001, and officially registered with the
    Frankfurt District Court in Germany, under registration number VR 12689. The
    mission of FCPAE is to foster communication and collaboration among member
    associations, enhance connections and interactions between scholars, and
    promote close cooperation with universities, research institutions, and
    professional associations across Europe and China. Its goal is to advance
    cooperation and development in the fields of science, education, culture,
    and industry between China and Europe.


    FCPAE brings together Chinese professional associations and institutions from more than ten countries across Europe. Since its establishment, with the presidents and councils of these associations at its core, FCPAE has actively carried out various exchange activities, organized more than 100 delegation visits to China, and established the Jinan Eurasian Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Base and the Xuzhou Overseas Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Base. FCPAE has also hosted dozens of international academic conferences in Europe and China, organized several public welfare activities, and successfully held 14 editions of the "FCPAE Europe Forum" in cities such as Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Vienna, The Hague, Frankfurt, Helsinki, Dublin, and Hamburg. These events have garnered enthusiastic attention and direct participation from governments, businesses, research institutions, universities, as well as related institutions from the European Union and the United Nations.


    Since its inception, the Federation has grown from 10 member associations to 62, with associations spanning countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. Collectively, these member associations represent more than 20,000 Chinese professionals working in various industries across Europe.


    The organizational structure of the Federation is modeled after the European Union, with the chair association and chair country rotating annually. However, unlike the EU, the chair association and chair country are not rotated in a fixed order but are elected democratically at the Federation's annual meeting. The 2023/2024 Executive Council members include rotating chair Ding Li, President Song Zhiwei, Secretary-General Liu Xiaoling, Treasurer Li Li, and Executive Deputy Secretary-General Luo Kai.

    全欧华人专业协会联合会（Federation of Chinese Professional Associations in Europe，简称
    FCPAE）成立于 2001 年 11 月 21 日，并在德国法兰克福地方法院正式注册，注册号为 VR 12689。FCPAE
    的使命是促进会员协会之间的交流与合作，增强学者间的联系与互动，同时推动与欧洲及中国高校、科研机构和行业协会的紧密合作。其宗旨在于促进中欧在科技、教育、文化及产业等领域的合作与发展。


    欧联会汇聚了遍布欧洲十多个国家的华人专业协会和机构。自成立以来，以各协会会长和理事会为核心，积极开展各类交流活动，组织回国考察访问超过百次，先后建立了济南欧亚科技创业基地和徐州海外科技创业基地。欧联会还在欧洲和中国举办了数十场国际学术研讨会，组织多项公益活动，并成功在巴黎、哥本哈根、布鲁塞尔、维也纳、海牙、法兰克福、赫尔辛基、都柏林、汉堡等城市举办了 14 届《FCPAE 欧洲论坛》。这些活动得到了欧洲、世界其他国家及欧盟、联合国相关机构的热情关注和积极参与。


    联合会自成立时的 10 个会员协会，已发展壮大到现在的 62 个，会员协会分布在德国、英国、法国、荷兰、比利时、奥地利、意大利、爱尔兰、西班牙、瑞士、瑞典、丹麦、芬兰等国，汇聚了遍布欧洲各行业的 2 万多名华人华侨专业人士。联合会的组织结构借鉴了欧盟模式，每年由不同国家的主席协会和主席国轮值。然而，与欧盟不同的是，主席协会和主席国并非按固定顺序轮换，而是在联合会的年度会议上通过民主选举产生。2023-2024 年度的常务理事会成员包括轮值主席丁力，主席宋志伟，秘书长刘晓玲，财务长李立，以及常务副秘书长罗恺。
